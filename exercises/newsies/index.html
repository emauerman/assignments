        <h1 align="center">SLC Sucks</h1>
            <p>Awful Drivers - <span>Utah</span> drivers are the worst i've ever seen.</P>
            <p>Expect to be tail gated at all times whether youre in the fast or slow lane, whether its clear/dry or puking snow.</p>
            <p>Maybe they should stop worrying so much about drinking laws and more about educating drivers on how to drive. At times I feel i'm more stressed out from the drivers on the road here than I was sitting in LA traffic.</p>
            <p>Specially when you see accidents left and right.</p>

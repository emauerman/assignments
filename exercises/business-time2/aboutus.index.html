                <p class="paragraph">In 1996, The Hamptons Bakery opened its first location on a quiet street corner in the heart of New York City’s West Village. From its inception, The Hamptons Bakery has been cherished for its classic American baked goods, vintage decor and warm, inviting atmosphere.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">In 2007, The Hamptons Bakery’s original owner passed her oven mitts to Steve and Tyra Abrams. Together, the Abrams’ have thoughtfully expanded the bakery from its first West Village shop to locations worldwide. Today, The Hamptons Bakery can be found in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., Mexico City, Seoul, Dubai, Riyadh, Amman, Abu Dhabi, Manila and Doha</p>
